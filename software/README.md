# Fjaelllada firmware overview

> For convenience you can use the [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just)
> to run commands.  
> Run `just --list` for an command overview.

## Developing

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) on your machine
2. Install sytem dependencies: `apt install python3-pyscard libpcsclite-dev pcscd` 
3. Install all python dependencies with `poetry install` or `just install`

Launching the project: take a look at the [justfile](justfile).
Run `just run-seil` to run the application for the upper locker locally
with an emulated card reader and gpio module.

## Deploying
> `libacsccid1` is required for the usb card reader. If another reader is used, this package might not be required
0. Install sytem dependencies on the Raspberry Pi: `apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pyscard libpcsclite-dev pcscd libacsccid1` 
1. run `just build` or `poetry build` on your dev machine
2. copy the wheel file to the Raspberry Pi
3. Install the wheel using `pip`
4. Copy `.xsession` over. This does autostarting the script

### Programm settings
The Program is configured with environment variables, which are documented
in the following table:

| Variable                   | Default Value  | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH    | 480            | Width in px the UI should have on the screen                                                                 |
| SCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT   | 320            | Height in px the UI should have on the screen                                                                |
| INPUT_PIN                  | 20             | GPIO pin on the RPi that is used to read the state of the door when running in `seil-locker` mode            |
| OUTPUT_PIN                 | 21             | GPIO pin on the RPi that is used to open  the door when running in `seil-locker` mode                        |
| TOTP_ISSUER                | jdav-locker-v1 | _todo_                    |
| DEBUG_SIMULATE_CARD_READER | ""             | set to `true` while developing. Fakes an attached card reader, returning the card ID `12345` every 2 seconds |
| DEBUG_SIMULATE_OUTPUT      | ""             | set to `true` while developing to fake GPIO drivers or an fake IÂ²C Bus                                       |

### File and Database structure

##### admin_db.txt
Plain text file, where each line represents one admin:
Each Line is a pyOTP URI, containing Name and Secret of the TOTP access

##### card_db.txt
Plain text file, where each line represents one user:  
Each line has the following format: `<card_id>;<user_name>`  
`<card>` is an uppercase hexadecimal 8-digit string without leading `0x`.
The length might change with different cards.  
Example: valid: `ABCDEF12`, invalid: `0xabcdef12`  
`<user_name` is a string chosen when activating a card, used for identifaction in logs.
